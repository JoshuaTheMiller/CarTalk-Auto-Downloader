# Before running... please read

As with any tool that helps automate tasks you would have done anyways, please use reasonably. As far as [NPR's Terms of Service reads](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use), you may only use this for personal and noncommercial use to retrieve the Car Talk episodes you would have downloaded for yourself anyways. This tool does not leverage NPR's APIs, so it *should* not fall under the API Content TOS. If you really enjoy Car Talk, think about [supporting NPR](https://www.npr.org/support) by [buying some swag](https://shop.npr.org/) and/or by [making a donation](https://www.npr.org/donations/support).

## How to install and use

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. From a command prompt, install this globally with `npm install -g cartalk-auto-downloader`.
3. Type `cartalkad` in a command prompt and hit enter. Further instructions will print out 😊

## Why did I make this?

Long story short, a friend of mine asked me if it was possible to do something like this. I remembered listening to Car Talk years ago (back when there was more time for adventures), and the nostalgia immediately drew me in. 

(...while it is true that I would have done this regardless of podcast, I'm always open to a good excuse for a new project that I might be able to finish 😀)

## What is this?

A tool to help click a bunch of download buttons with only your keyboard! It is an... auto downloader 🤔
